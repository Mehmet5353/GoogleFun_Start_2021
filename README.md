Here is the solution of the Reversort from Google Code Jam 2021, the only question is solved by me. 
Brief explanation of the question is that there is a list you should reverse and sort in increasing order.
In the first step, smallest value is swapped by the number in the first index, unless smallest number is equal to the number in the first index.
This process continue until list sorted. In every iteration, you are adding cost to j(the index of the smallest number in the iteration)-i(the index o )+1.
